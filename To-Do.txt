Things to do 

Critical:
-Determine what information we need regularly from arduino and change packet
-Comment code/make a tutorial so people can actually install and run the repo

Important:
-Get Xbee to give connection strength and state
-Calculate voltage vs. batt % curve and give + battery warning
-Comment code
-Clean up drawing method for points on map


Nice to have:
-Re-write map drawing to choose file based on selection
-Make sure file outputs don't overwrite
-Make folders for data and log outputs
-Correct order of all lat/long methods so they are consistent and actually make sense

When possible:
-Make tutorial/overview document for git
-Make Java tutorial
